Building a Basic RESTful API to Retrieve User Data Overview This project involves creating a RESTful API using Node.js and Express to retrieve user data from a JSON file. 
The API supports endpoints to list all users, fetch users by ID, profession, or name, and ensures proper error handling for invalid inputs.


Features Retrieve all user data. Fetch specific user details by ID, profession, or name. Error messages for invalid IDs, professions, or names. Tested thoroughly using Postman for functionality and reliability. 
Testing All endpoints were tested using Postman, and screenshots are included in the project to demonstrate successful results and error handling.
